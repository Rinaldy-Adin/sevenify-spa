# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): You need Node.js to run JavaScript and npm packages.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-react-vite-project.git
```

2. Change your current working directory to the project folder:

```bash
cd your-react-vite-project
```
3. Install project dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

4. To start the development server and run your React project, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```
